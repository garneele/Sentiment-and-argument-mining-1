Whatever direction global energy policies take in the future, it is indisputable that carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere will continue to rise. There is still uncertainty about the ultimate destination of carbon dioxide. It seems that roughly half the fossil fuel output has remained in the atmosphere, and early workers supposed that the remainder was consumed by the oceans and the biosphere. But the role of the biosphere is now a matter of hot debate. Some research has suggested that far from being a sink for carbon dioxide, the biosphere (through deforestation and changing land use) could actually be a source. Other work suggests the contrary, or that the role of the biosphere has actually changed with time. But it is inescapable that atmospheric concentrations have already climbed by 15% as a result of man’s activities during this century and there seems little doubt that concentrations would be double present values around the middle of the next century if current growth rates for the use of fossil fuels (over 4% per annum) were to persist. This is unlikely, of course, given the depletion of energy resources, but at least the figure gives some sort of guide for realistic modelling.\n",

There is also consensus that the hydrological cycle would become more active—with precipitation and evaporation levels both rising. Beyond this there is still scope for quantitative disagreement, but a commonly quoted figure is that a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide would result in a world global annual mean surface temperature rise of 2 to 3 °C, with marked latitudinal asymmetry. As yet, however, no model adequately accounts for changes in the ice-covered regions of the world or in the hydrosphere (particularly ocean currents), and there is considerable room for disagreement regarding the importance of feedback effects arising from changes in cloud cover.\n",

Surely not, provided that sensible perspectives are maintained. A recent workshop jointly sponsored by the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the US Department of Energy has been attempting to lay transdisciplinary foundations for a federally supported research programme on the impact of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide content and it is not too early for other nations (or more reasonably groups of nations, such as the European Economic Community) to take similar initiatives.
